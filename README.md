# 8-Puzzle Game

The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square. The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board position (left) to the goal position (right).

The code uses various search algorightms to determine the best possible path or number of changes in order to get to the goal state. This is and can be specified by inputing the goal state into the code or utilizing the randomizer in order to ensure the program can correct itself to achieve the goal state.
